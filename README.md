# Hello!
### It's Brain Games
You must give 3 correct answers. Only then will you win the deserved victory!
P.S. I think sometimes you can use the calculator :)

You can choose one of the three games to play:
- Even/not even (brain-even)
- Calculator (brain-calc)
- Greatest common divisor (brain-gcd)
- Prime/not prime (brain-prime)
- Find hidden number (brain-progression)

There are also asciinema to be understood.

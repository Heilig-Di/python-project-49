# Hello!
## It's Brain Games

You can choose one of the three games to play:
- Even/not even (brain-even)
- Calculator (brain-calc)
- Greatest common divisor (brain-gcd)
- Prime/not prime (brain-prime)

To launch the game you can use 'make' and the game shortening respectively.
For exemple: _make brain-even_

You must give 3 correct answers. Only then will you win the deserved victory!
P.S. I think sometimes you can use the calculator :)

There are also asciinema to be understood:
